3D CHESS

HOW TO RUN ==================================
1. Run ./host.command
2. Navigate to localhost:8000


HOW TO PLAY =================================

The playing experience is fairly intuitive.

The white player goes first; to move, click the sqare underneath the piece you want to move, and the valid tiles you can
move to will show up highlighted in red.  Click on one of those tiles to move the piece there. To unselect a piece, just click
anywhere else on the board.


DEPENDENCIES ================================

We're using tiny-graphics.js for our graphics library.  That's about it!
